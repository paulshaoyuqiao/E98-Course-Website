  <h2> Our Story </h2>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <div class="segment">
  A few years ago, a student called Gustavo De Leon from Berkeley 🐻 realized there 
  was a big problem: a lot of students without programming experience had a hard time 
  😟 in CS 61A, compared to their fellow students who have programmed for years. So he 
  founded this course, aiming to prepare students for challenging programming 
  classes at Berkeley, as well as to give a friendly introduction to anyone who is 
  interested in learning computer science. He named it "Intro to CS Bootcamp" ⛺.
  <br><br>
  Now, we have served hundreds of students over winter ☃️ and summer ⛱️ breaks, 
  teaching them programming concepts via interactive lab practices (promise you will 
  love the references in there!), programming exercises, etc. Students have reported 
  to us how much of a positive impact the course has made in their CS 61A experience, 
  and how they are more prepared for the challenges ahead of them. Most importantly, 
  they told us they enjoyed the CS learning process 😃!
  <br><br>
  So welcome, my friends, to a new world 🌎.
